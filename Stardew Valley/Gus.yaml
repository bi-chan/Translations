Never again!$3#$e#Have a wonderful night tonight, @!" #!String

    spring_Tue6: "The first time I cooked for someone, it was by accident. My mother needed to make some cookies, but she fell asleep.#$b#I picked up where she left off, and she was so proud.

    spring_Wed6: "I really wish you could have tried Pelican Pale Ale, @. It was wonderful.$2#$b#I get people from other towns who stop by and ask for it. I have to say no one makes it anymore. If only someone could find the recipe...#$e#Anyway, halfway to the weekend. Have a good one!" #!String

    spring_Sun6: "If someone cut off my arms, I would cook with my teeth. If they took out my teeth, I'd cook with my nose!#$b#And if they cut off my nose? I'd give up cooking and seek vengeance, @! Vengeance!$3#$e#Get some good rest, @! The week starts again tomorrow." #!String
    spring_Mon8: "Spring is a season of love for me, @. All of my greatest loves were in spring.$1#$b#I had one spring that was spent with my lover, drinking wine and each other.#$b#You don't think I could do it? I was the best!$1#$e#See you around, @! The door is always open for you!" #!String
    spring_Tue8: "With love in the air, I get excited, @, I really do. Today I made everything with a spring in my step.#$b#To be young enough to love as freely as I did then! But it is not to be. I've had my fun, @!$1#$e#See you soon, @! Keep doing wonderfully!" #!String
    spring_Wed8: "Love can surprise you, @, it can. One of my craziest loves came from a fellow cook, who told me my own cooking was awful.#$b#I dared them to try and out-cook me, and what started at their house, ended in their bed!$1#$b#I don't remember who won, in the end...#$e#Anyway, halfway to the weekend. Have a good one!" #!String

    spring_Sun8: "Let me tell you, @, that if you ever experience heartbreak, that it will make you stronger. It will hurt, but never give in to the pain.$3#$b#I speak from experience. Never give in to the feelings of despair!$2#$e#Get some good rest, @! The week starts again tomorrow." #!String
    spring_Mon10: "When I discovered this place, @, this Saloon, I was heartbroken. I had lost the love of my life.$2#$b#I thought we would be together forever, cooking and being in love. We would have.$3#$b#But sometimes people get sick, @! Then, they are gone, and with them, my heart.$2#$e#Pardon me! Have a good night, @!" #!String
    spring_Tue10: "I was once a patron here, @. Drinking my sorrows away. It was a problem. Then the old owner asked if I wanted to work in the kitchen, and eventually, own the place.#$b#I said yes. It had been the dream of my lover and I to own a restaurant. I do it for their memory.$1#$e#See you soon, @! Keep doing wonderfully!" #!String
    spring_Wed10: "I learned this when I took over the place: pain is temporary.

    spring_Fri10: "When the owner asked if I would change the name of the Saloon, I said no. The stardrop is a beautiful thing, why remove something beautiful from the sign?#$b#Am I wrong? The name is catchy, as well!$1#$e#It's the weekend! Have a good one." #!String
    spring_Sat10: "My lover passed away in a far away land, and I'm still not sure if being so far away helped the pain, or made it worse.$2#$b#Such thoughts on a night like this!? Let us be merry in each other's company, @!#$e#See you again, @! I look forward to it." #!String
    spring_Sun10: "@! I was hoping you'd come here tonight, for I made the food with you in mind. Especially the beer! Brewed with love!$1#$e#Get some good rest, @! The week starts again tomorrow." #!String

    summer_Wed: "The Saloon is the coldest place in all of Pelican Town during summer. It must be the way they designed the building. Can you feel it, @?#$b#You can't get that refreshing air anywhere else!$1#$e#Anyway, halfway to the weekend. Have a good one!" #!String
    summer_Thu: "Summer is a great time for alcohol. Summer brews from all over the world come in, and it's a pleasure to drink them.#$b#The taste of the sun, truly inspiring!$1#$e#Have a wonderful night tonight, @!" #!String

    summer_Fri2: "Wouldn't it be nice to have more dances in here? I could relive my old days. Put up lights, turn up the jukebox, that sort of thing.#$b#It would be an interesting change in the looks of this place, though!$1#$e#It's the weekend! Have a good one." #!String
    summer_Sat2: "Another unsavory character that frequented this place was a woman called the Dark Warlock Magnifica. She could drink her fill, I hear.#$b#She fell in love with a patron, and one night went off with him. He was never seen again!#$e#See you again, @! I look forward to it." #!String

I'll never cook that good again!$1#$e#Anyway, halfway to the weekend. Have a good one!" #!String

    summer_Sat4: "When a member of royalty asks you to cook their favorite dish, how should you cook it? There's only one answer.$3#$b#The way they want it! If you cook it the way you want it, your head will be off and rolling down the street!$1#$e#See you again, @! I look forward to it." #!String

I gave them crackers and called it quits.$3#$e#See you soon, @! Keep doing wonderfully!" #!String

Strange how it all works out!$3#$e#Anyway, halfway to the weekend. Have a good one!" #!String
    summer_Thu6: "You know your passion and your purpose when you try to do something else and it burns your heart. I tried to be a writer once, of poetry.#$b#I hated it!

Have a good one." #!String
    summer_Sat6: "Today I had to throw out an entire batch of pizza. It was awful, in no way I was going to serve it to people!$3#$b#As a cook, you must have respect for your own reputation. I don't serve garbage, so into the garbage it went!#$e#See you again, @! I look forward to it." #!String
